        </div><p class="lead mb-5"></p><div class="subheading mb-5">Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common type of arthritis in kids and teens. It typically causes joint pain and inflammation in the hands, knees, ankles, elbows and/or wrists. But, it may affect other body parts too . JIA used to be called juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), but the name changed because it is not a kid version of the adult disease. The term “juvenile arthritis” is used to describe all the joint conditions that affects kids and teens, including JIA.</div>

            <div class="subheading mb-3">JIA types are autoimmune or autoinflammatory diseases. That means the immune system, which is supposed to fight invaders like germs and viruses, gets confused and attacks the body’s cells and tissues . This causes the body to release inflammatory chemicals that attack the synovium (tissue lining around a joint). It produces fluid that cushions joints and helps them move smoothly. An inflamed synovium may make a joint feel painful or tender, look red or swollen or difficult to move.  
</div>
            
            
          <div class="subheading mb-3">The word “idiopathic” means unknown, and researchers aren’t sure why kids develop JIA. They believe kids with JIA have certain genes that are activated by a virus, bacteria or other external factors. But there is no evidence that foods, toxins, allergies or lack of vitamins cause the disease.</div></div>

        <h2 class="mb-5">What are the types of JIA?</h2>

        <div class="subheading mb-3">There are six types of JIA:</div>
        

        
        
      <div class="subheading mb-3">Oligoarthritis: Affects four or fewer joints, typically the large ones (knees, ankles, elbows). Most common subtype of JIA.

</div><div class="subheading mb-3">Polyarthritis: Affects five or more joints, often on both sides of the body (both knees, both wrists, etc.). May affect large and small joints. Affects about 25% of children with JIA.

</div><div class="subheading mb-3">Systemic: Affects the entire body (joints, skin and internal organs). Symptoms may include a high spiking fever (103°F or higher) that lasts at least two weeks and rash. Affects about 10% of children with JIA.

</div><div class="subheading mb-3">Psoriatic arthritis (PsA): Joint symptoms and a scaly rash behind the ears and/or on the eyelids, elbows, knees, belly button and scalp. Skin symptoms may occur before or after joint symptoms appear. May affect one or more joints, often the wrists, knees, ankles, fingers or toes. 

</div><div class="subheading mb-3">Enthesitis-related: Also known as spondyloarthritis. Affects where the muscles, ligaments or tendons attach to the bone (entheses). Commonly affects the hips, knees and feet, but may also affect the fingers, elbows, pelvis, chest, digestive tract (Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis) and lower back (ankylosing spondylitis). More common in boys; typically appears in children between the ages of eight and 15. 

</div><div class="subheading mb-3">Undifferentiated: Symptoms don’t match up perfectly with any of the subtypes, but inflammation is present in one or more joints.

        <h2 class="mb-5">What is the cure for jia?</h2>
        <p></p><div class="subheading mb-3">There is no cure for JIA but remission (little or no disease activity or symptoms) is possible.  Early aggressive treatment is key to getting the disease under control as quickly as possible. 

</div><div class="subheading mb-3">The goals of JIA treatment are to:

</div><div class="subheading mb-3">- Slow down or stop inflammation. 

</div><div class="subheading mb-3">- Relieve symptoms, control pain and improve quality of life.

</div><div class="subheading mb-3">- Prevent joint and organ damage.

</div><div class="subheading mb-3">- Preserve joint function and mobility. 

</div><div class="subheading mb-3">- Reduce long-term health effects.

</div><div class="subheading mb-3">- Achieve remission (little or no disease activity or symptoms).

</div><div class="subheading mb-3">Treatment for JIA varies depending on disease type and severity. A well-rounded plan includes medication, complementary therapies and healthy lifestyle habits.
